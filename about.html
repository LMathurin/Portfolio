         <div class="about-me__body">
           <p> I am originally from South Florida but currently reside in Austin, Texas.</p>
           <p>My career journey first started when I was 18 fresh out of highschool and decided to join the Marine Corps.</p>
           <p> After almost 9 yrs active duty and multiple deployments I was serverlly injured and my time serving came to an unexpected end.
            <p>With that quick turning point in my life and not having a clue on what career path I even wanted to pursue as a civilian. </p>
           <p> With this new begining it seemed liked, I was offered a position into the Gym industry and was a GM of UFC Gym for a couple years until it closed down. </p>
           <p>then went into the home healthcare Industry with managing homes for a company who cared for individuals with intellectual disabilites, which was the most fufilling job Ive had.</p>
            <p>Now in my 30's I guess I finally decided to take control of my own path where I will find purpose, fufillment and that constent challenge as when I served in the military. </p>
           And learning that a programmer you gain so much more from it that will add value to all aspects to my life, so I took the leap and made the career change and here I am! </p>
